The code implements an analytic continuation of the amplitude to the complex plane and calculation of the effictive range parameters.


The main types exported are:
```julia
struct πDD <: AbstractxDD  # both isospin channels
struct γDD <: AbstractxDD
```
with a specific `decay_matrix_element_squared(d::AbstractxDD,s,σ3,σ2)` for every type.

The decay amplitude integrated over the phase space is called via

```julia
ρ_thr(d::AbstractxDD, e)
```
The latter can be precalculated using the `interpolated` method,
```julia
interpolated(channel::AbstractxDD, cutoff::Real; estep=0.01)
```
at the value of `cutoff` the expression is merged to the two-body phase-space function. The default value of the discrete grid is 0.01 MeV.

The precalculated structure can be used to calculate the dispersion integral:
```julia
dispersive(d::interpolated,e)
```
returns a complex value, for which `Im(dispersive) = ρ_thr`.
